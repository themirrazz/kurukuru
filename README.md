# kurukuruai
KuruKuruAI is an under-development AI used for predicting a defined number of output numbers based on input numbers. It will be available in JavaScript for client-side (browsers) and Node.JS, followed by a C# port.

## Progress
```
[#-------------------]
5%: You can train the AI. That's it.
```

## What you should use it for
* AIs in games that need to follow the player (e.g. car chases)
* Recommending a movie a user would like based on the last three movies they watched
* Games where moves that are predefined and have a limited number of outcomes (e.g. chess)

## What you should NOT use it for
* Generating images, text, videos, audios, or anything bc it's not generative AI
* Games with over-complicated rules
* Text sentiment recognition (I'll make another AI for that later)
* Basically anything important
* Or anything that isn't a number
